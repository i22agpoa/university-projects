# University Projects

This repository contains a curated selection of academic projects and exercises developed during my Computer Engineering degree.

The goal is to showcase **core programming skills**, **problem-solving abilities**, and **clean, well-documented code**, using technologies commonly applied in professional environments.

## Contents
- **C++ Programming**: object-oriented programming, data structures, file handling
- **SQL Databases**: relational schema design and query exercises

> Note: These projects were developed in an academic context and have been organized and documented for clarity.
